### Prompt:
@src/config/app.config.ts  split this into small configs that each use the registerAs from the nestjs config service and do all the changes needed on the app , here is the relevant docs part :https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#namespaced-configurations-in-modules

### Changed Files:

- `src/config/app.config.ts`
- `src/app.module.ts`
- `src/config/interfaces/app-config.interface.ts`

### Highlights:

- Created a new `app.config.ts` to handle application-specific configurations, such as the throttler settings.
- Updated `app.module.ts` to asynchronously load the throttler configuration from `app.config.ts`, making the setup more modular and dynamic.
- Introduced a new `app-config.interface.ts` to define the structure of the application configuration, improving type safety and code clarity.
- Modified the `ThrottlerModule` to use the new configuration, ensuring that the application's rate-limiting settings are now managed through the global configuration service.
